# shrkbot
A bot for the twitch channel twitch.tv/trueblackshark, created using the [cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch) IRC bot framework.


### Setting up

Requires a YAML file called '.login', containing the name of your bot as well as your name on twitch, and your bot's oauth token. Your final file should look something like this:

>---
>"botname": "shrkbot"  
>"botowner": "trueblackshark"  
>"oauth": "oauth:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  



# Available commands
There are four permission levels, always specified behind each command.
(o) = botowner (The person running the bot)
(c) = channel owner (The broadcaster)
(m) = moderators
(e) = everyone
These are in descending order, and each tier always includes all the ones below it (so the channel owner can call (c), (m) and (e) commands), except in the giveaway system. Parameters are specified with '[]'. Optional parameters are specified with '{}'. For more details, check the code of the respective modules.
